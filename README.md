## Description

I created a command line application to access a sql company database. Here, you will be able to use features such as viewing and updating employees, departments, and roles. 

## Installation
To install this app, you will need to install npm and mysql and be able to access mysql databases. After doing this, you will need to run the commands "source schema.sql" and "source seeds.sql" in your local mysql. Then, you can use the command "npm start" in your command line to start the application. 

Here is a screen recording of my application in action:

## Usage
To use this app, simply access the command line, follow the installation instructions, and run "npm start" in your command line.
